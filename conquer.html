    <p>This hypothetical was actually addressed by the series’ creators. 
        He said that if Light had never found the Death Note, he would have gone to college, studied law, 
        joined the police force, and have become one of the most celebrated police detectives in history. 
        He and L would have also become colleagues and collaborate to solve the world’s toughest crimes.
        Ohba and Obata claim that Light’s insanity was triggered by the Death Note; he simply wasn’t prepared
        to have that kind of power and it fuelled the already high opinion he had of himself into a god complex. 
        Had that not happened, he would have channel his potential into something more positive. He’d still be a narcissist,
         but at least he would be putting it to good use.</p>
